-- app_usage_days is written with an upsert (INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE,
-- see lib/appUsage.ts). Under RLS that path must be able to read the conflicting
-- row to resolve the conflict, but the table shipped with NO select policy on
-- purpose - so every upsert was denied with 42501 and the table stayed empty.
--
-- The insert/update policies are already present here; only the SELECT policy was
-- missing. Add it scoped to the caller's OWN rows. Users can only ever see their
-- own usage days (data they generated themselves), so this is not a privacy
-- regression: other users' rows stay hidden, and the owner-facing cross-user
-- rollup still runs through the service role (which bypasses RLS).

drop policy if exists "app_usage_days_select_own" on public.app_usage_days;
create policy "app_usage_days_select_own" on public.app_usage_days
  for select to authenticated
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);
