### Framing Notes (internal — do not submit)
- Lead with journaling and pattern tracking, not astrology
- Position astrology as a "reflection lens" not a predictive tool
- Emphasize privacy, encryption, and on-device storage
- Use "pattern engine" language over "horoscope" language
- Highlight mood/energy check-ins as the primary data source
- Astrology insights are framed as one input among many (mood, journal, time of day, patterns)
